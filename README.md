# WP Seed Plugin

All you need to start creating a plugin for WordPress.

We aim to deliver a focus on the API features of WordPress and it's eventual use as a headless CMS, but feel free to use this base for any kind of plugin. It provides several features that will enable you to develop and test your code.

## Getting started

### Find and Replace

This project is a skeleton, so it has a bunch of keys that need to be replaced with values specific to your project.

For these changes, you should use the "Find and Replace" feature of your editor. Later there will be more options to this. Below you can find the table with the keys and their respective description, along with an example for the possible value.
